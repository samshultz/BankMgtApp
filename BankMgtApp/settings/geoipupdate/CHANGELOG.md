# CHANGELOG

## 4.3.0 (2020-04-16)

* First release to Docker Hub. Requested by Shun Yanaura. GitHub #24.
* The binary builds are now built with `CGO_ENABLED=0`. Request by CrazyMax.
  GitHub #63.

## 4.2.2 (2020-02-21)

* Re-release for PPA. No other changes.

## 4.2.1 (2020-02-21)

* The minimum Go version is now 1.10 again as this was needed to build the PPA
  packages.

## 4.2.0 (2020-02-20)

* The major version of the module is now included at the end of the module
  path. Previously, it was not possible to import the module in projects that
  were using Go modules. Reported by Roman Glushko. GitHub #81.
* The minimum Go version is now 1.13.
* A valid account ID and license key combination is now required for database
  downloads, so those configuration options are now required.
* The error handling when closing a local database file would previously
  ignore errors and, upon upgrading to `github.com/pkg/errors` 0.9.0,
  would fail to ignore expected errors. Reported by Ilya Skrypitsa and
  pgnd. GitHub #69 and #70.
* The RPM release was previously lacking the correct owner and group on files
  and directories. Among other things, this caused the package to conflict with
  the `GeoIP` package in CentOS 7 and `GeoIP-GeoLite-data` in CentOS 8. The
  files are now owned by `root`. Reported by neonknight. GitHub #76.

## 4.1.5 (2019-11-08)

* Respect the defaultConfigFile and defaultDatabaseDirectory variables in
  the main package again. They were ignored in 4.1.0 through 4.1.4. If not
  specified, the GitHub and PPA releases for these versions used the config
  /usr/local/etc/GeoIP.conf instead of /etc/GeoIP.conf and the database
  directory /usr/local/share/GeoIP instead of /usr/share/GeoIP.

## 4.1.4 (2019-11-07)

* Re-release of 4.1.3 as two commits were missing. No changes.

* Remove formatting, linting, and testing from the geoipupdate target in
  the Makefile.
